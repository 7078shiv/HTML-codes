             England—died March 14, 2018, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire), English theoretical physicist whose
              theory of exploding black holes drew upon both relativity theory and quantum mechanics.
               He also worked with space-time singularities.</i><br><br>

               <p style="padding:10px">Hawking began his schooling at the 
                   Byron House School in Highgate, London. He later blamed its "progressive methods" for his failure to learn to read while at the school.[39][32] In St Albans, the eight-year-old Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months. At that time,
                    younger boys could attend one of the houses.</p>

                <p>Stephen Hawking (1942 – 2018) is an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist and author. He is best known for his attempts to explain in clear terms the origins of the universe and some of the most complicated aspects of the cosmos and physics. Hawking was the first scientist to offer a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics.</p>
