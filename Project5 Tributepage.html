    <h1>The Life of Irrfan</h1>
    <p>Khan was born on 7 January 1967 in Tonk, Rajasthan into a Muslim family of Pathani ancestry.[19][20]
         Khan's mother, Saeeda Begum Khan was from Tonk, and his father, Yaseen Ali Khan, was from the Khajuriya village
          in Rajasthan's Tonk district, and they ran a tyre business.[21][22][23][24] He spent his childhood in Tonk, and then Jaipur. 
          Irrfan was good at cricket and was selected to play in the CK Nayudu Trophy for emerging players in the under-23 category,
           a tournament seen as a stepping stone to first-class cricket in India. However, he did not attend as he could not afford
            travel expenses.</p>
              <p>
                He showed interest in acting under the influence of his maternal uncle who himself was a theatre artist in Jodhpur.[26] In Jaipur, Khan was introduced to noted theatre artists and did several stage performances in the city. 
                Khan completed his MA in Jaipur before joining the National School of Drama (NSD) in New Delhi in 1984 to study acting.

               In his early days in Mumbai, he took up a job as an air conditioner
               repairman and visited the home of his acting inspiration, Rajesh Khanna,
               in 1984.[29] Later in an interview Irfan stated, "The kind of craze witnessed by Rajesh Khanna has not been duplicated by anyone. He was the biggest and the most real star Bollywood has produced. I'd say stardom is that feeling of being possessed by your idol;
               you are so overwhelmed with euphoria you lose touch with reality.
